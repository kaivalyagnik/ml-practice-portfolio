#  Machine Learning Practice Portfolio

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Practice Portfolio** — a curated collection of end-to-end projects across various regression and classification problems.

Each dataset project includes:
-  A problem statement and evaluation metrics
-  Model training and testing results
-  Key takeaways and insights

##  Key Takeaways

###  California Housing
- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** outperform Linear Regression significantly.
- Default Random Forest already gave a strong RMSE of ~48910.
- Tuning didn’t improve performance much—suggesting default parameters were well-balanced.

###  Insurance Charges
- **Random Forest with One-Hot Encoding** gave the best overall performance.
- **One-Hot Encoding** consistently outperformed **Ordinal** in both linear and tree models.
- **XGBoost** was robust and less sensitive to encoding types.
- **Linear Regression** benefitted marginally from One-Hot Encoding but lagged behind ensembles.

###  Heart Disease Classification
- **Logistic Regression (Fine-Tuned)** achieved the best accuracy (88.6%) and recall (93%) for detecting heart disease.
- **Random Forest (Default)** also performed well (accuracy ~87%), but tuned version slightly underperformed, indicating over-tuning risk.
- **GridSearchCV with StratifiedKFold** ensured robust tuning and evaluation.
- **Logistic Regression** remains a strong choice for interpretable and high-performing models on structured binary classification tasks.

###  Diabetes Classification
- **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the best overall performance with high accuracy and ROC-AUC scores.
- Cross-validation ensured robustness of the results.
- ROC-AUC curves show strong class separation.
- Future enhancements: consider SMOTE for class imbalance and fine-tune hyperparameters.
