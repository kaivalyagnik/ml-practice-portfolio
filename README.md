# 🧠 ML Practice Portfolio

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Practice Portfolio** — a curated collection of end-to-end projects across various regression and classification problems.

Each dataset project includes:
- 📓 A clean and well-documented Jupyter Notebook
- 📃 A README with problem statement and evaluation metrics
- 📊 Model training and testing results
- 🔍 Key takeaways and insights
